# TextRAG-bot-project
## Introduction

Have you ever wished for a superhero sidekick who could swiftly read and comprehend documents for you? Meet **TextRAGBot** - a tool designed to utilize RAG for document reading and interaction via a user-friendly chatbot interface built with Chainlit.

ðŸš€ This project is engineered to operate seamlessly on both Google Colab and locally, ensuring accessibility for everyone!

**Note**: This project is part of my submission for the first module of an AI Course.
